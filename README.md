# Pixeltor

Pixeltor is a simple bash script (available in spanish and english) that seeks
to be an entertaining alternative to make pixelart on a terminal, this using the
available colors of your terminal (up to 256!).

Many of us like to leave a "signature" on our scripts when we execute them. The
asciiart is often an unfeasible alternative when coding is not feasible.  or
when the length of the characters varies, however, you do not have to do so.
worry about these problems by using only spaces, literal only characters of
space.

Here are a few examples of how you can let your imagination run wild:

If you like my work and would like to help me some satoshis or dogecoins would
be from a lot of help.
